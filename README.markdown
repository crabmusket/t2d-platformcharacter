# t2d-platformcharacter

A platformer character behavior for the [Torque 2D][] game engine.

  [Torque 2D]: https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque2D

# Installation

I recommend cloning this repository right into your T2D folder:

```
cd modules/
git clone git@github.com:eightyeight/t2d-platformcharacter PlatformCharacter
```

Or you can achieve the same effect by [downloading a ZIP file][Download].
Note that this will download the latest version of the `master` branch, which will be stable
but may be out of date.
